# Build a report using Streamlit and Snowflake ML

Walk through the [Getting Started with Snowflake ML](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/intro_to_machine_learning_with_snowpark_ml_for_python) quickstart to create a model from the Diamonds dataset. After that, you can copy the code in `report.py` and upload `environment.yml` into Streamlit in Snowflake to create an interactive report.
